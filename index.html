<h1> About Me</h1>    
<p>My name is Rohan Ravula and I am a high school student in Cerritos. I am a rising sophmore and I am excited to learn more about technology. I live with my Mom, Dad, Grandmother, my Aunt, and a younger sibling so I'm always doing something. One of the things you should know about me is that I love to learn and am always open to new things. I am redy to take on the challenge of learning HTML and CSS and am excited for what it is going to bring!</p>
